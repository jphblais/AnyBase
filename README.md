Any base
========

This class emulate the base numbers arithmetic using a custom characters dictionary.

The base intend was to generate a list of codes of fixed length.  So this class has been developed
using the minimum requirements for the project I'm working on.

The only operation available is increment but other cool stuff need to be developed.

Want to add more functions, send me your pull request.  I'll be very happy to merge it.
